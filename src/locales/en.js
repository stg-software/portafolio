    paragraphs: {
      intro: 'My journey in technology began at age 12 in Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca, when I discovered I could create entire worlds with code. From GW Basic to Python, from C++ to Vue.js, more than 20 years later, my career has been a constant evolution driven by three passions: learning, creating, and solving problems.',
      mission: 'But my story goes beyond lines of code. Two years as a missionary taught me that technology is just a tool; what really matters is the impact you generate. I learned to communicate complex ideas simply, to lead with empathy, and to always have a Plan B (and C, and D) when things don\'t go as expected.',
      leader: 'As Development Team Lead at Ingeaa, I led a team of 4 developers under Scrum methodology. I also managed teams of up to 20 people in technology migration projects and developed critical integration between Microsoft Dynamics and the company\'s proprietary system. I reduced codebases by 60% and improved load times from 20 seconds to less than 5.',
      ai: 'I recently completed my Master\'s Degree in Artificial Intelligence (awaiting official title, October 2025), not just because I\'m fascinated by the field, but because I believe that AI + web development + educational thinking can create truly transformative digital experiences.',
      personal: 'When I\'m not writing code, I actively serve in my church, spend quality time with my wife and two children, play guitar (from boleros to alternative rock), explore mountain trails, or enjoy the beach. Because to create human technology, you must first be human.'
